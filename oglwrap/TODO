Todo list:

last edited: 

+ General:
    - Context class.
    - Program uniforms.
    - Uniform blocks / shader storage.
    - Separable shader stages.
    - Some other 4.0+ features are still missing.

+ Utilities
    - Shapes
        - Basic geometry shapes (e.g. torus).
        - Random low-poly objects for testing, like animals, trees, etc.
    - More camera styles
        - Not only with SFML.
    - Basic object and character mover classes.
    - Shadowing support / predefined shaders for testing.

+ Physics
    - Built-in Inverse Kinematics support.
    - Mesh hair simulation.
    - Collision detection / Reaction.
    - Possibly rag-doll physics.

+ Documentation
    - Examples
    - Rewrite the readme
    - Add 'how to use' into class' documentations.

+ Debug
    - Logger for debug output
        - GUI for watching it (including documentation browser).
        - Probably with profiling support.
